# Gpt_integration

Project Name: Image Vision API with OpenAI GPT-4
This project enables users to upload images and get detailed descriptions of those images using the vision capabilities of OpenAI GPT-4. By leveraging OpenAI's powerful API, the system can process images and answer questions about them, allowing for versatile use-cases such as image classification, object detection, and general content understanding.

Features
Image Upload: Users can upload images either via URL or base64 encoded format.
Image Processing: The system sends the image to the GPT-4 model, which processes the image and provides a detailed textual description.
Multiple Image Inputs: The system supports multiple image inputs, allowing comparison or collective analysis of images.
Fidelity Control: Users can control the image processing detail, choosing between low and high fidelity for faster or more detailed results.
API: A simple API interface to upload images and receive responses.
Vision
This application demonstrates how OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4 with vision capabilities can interpret images in a variety of contexts, allowing for an enriched experience where both visual and textual data are processed together. We aim to explore use-cases from basic image descriptions to more complex image comparisons.

Quickstart Guide
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
OpenAI API Key
Required Python Libraries:
openai
fastapi
requests
uvicorn
Install the necessary libraries:

bash
Copier le code
pip install openai fastapi uvicorn requests
Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copier le code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
Set up the OpenAI API Key: Make sure you have your OpenAI API key. Set the API key as an environment variable:

bash
Copier le code
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key'
Start the FastAPI server: Run the server using Uvicorn:

bash
Copier le code
uvicorn app:app --reload
Your server will now be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Usage
Upload Image
To use the image vision capabilities, users can upload an image either through a URL or base64-encoded string.

Example Request with Image URL
python
Copier le code
import openai

# Initialize the OpenAI client
openai.api_key = "your-api-key"

# Define the request with image URL
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
  model="gpt-4",
  messages=[
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {"type": "text", "text": "What is in this image?"},
        {
          "type": "image_url",
          "image_url": {
            "url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg",
          },
        },
      ],
    }
  ],
  max_tokens=300,
)

print(response.choices[0].message['content'])
Example Request with Base64 Image
python
Copier le code
import openai
import base64

# Function to encode the image
def encode_image(image_path):
    with open(image_path, "rb") as image_file:
        return base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode('utf-8')

# Initialize the OpenAI client
openai.api_key = "your-api-key"

# Path to your image
image_path = "path_to_your_image.jpg"
base64_image = encode_image(image_path)

# Define the request with base64 image
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
  model="gpt-4",
  messages=[
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {"type": "text", "text": "What is in this image?"},
        {
          "type": "image_url",
          "image_url": {
            "url": f"data:image/jpeg;base64,{base64_image}"
          },
        },
      ],
    }
  ],
  max_tokens=300,
)

print(response.choices[0].message['content'])
API Reference
Endpoints
POST /upload-image

Description: Upload an image (either via URL or base64 encoded) and get a description from OpenAI GPT-4.
Request Body:
image_url: URL to the image.
image_base64: Base64 encoded image (one or the other, not both).
question: Optional: Question to ask about the image (e.g., "What is in this image?").
Response:
A detailed description of the image from GPT-4.
Example Request:

bash
Copier le code
curl -X 'POST' \
'http://127.0.0.1:8000/upload-image' \
-H 'accept: application/json' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
"image_url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg",
"question": "What is in this image?"
}'
Limitations
Medical Images: Not suitable for interpreting specialized medical images such as CT scans.
Non-English Text: The model may not perform optimally with non-Latin text (e.g., Japanese, Korean).
Spatial Reasoning: The model struggles with tasks requiring precise spatial localization, such as identifying objects in an image.
Accuracy: The model may generate inaccurate or incomplete descriptions in some cases.
File Size: Image uploads are limited to a 20MB maximum per image.
Calculating Costs
The token cost for image inputs depends on the size and resolution of the image. Here's how the costs are calculated:

Low Fidelity: 85 tokens per image.
High Fidelity: 170 tokens for each 512px x 512px tile.
For example:

A 1024x1024 image in high detail would cost 765 tokens.
FAQ
Can I fine-tune GPT-4 for image understanding?
No, fine-tuning for image capabilities is not supported.

Can GPT-4 generate images?
No, GPT-4 is designed to understand images, not generate them. Use DALL-E for image generation.

What types of image files are supported?
We support PNG, JPEG, WEBP, and non-animated GIF files.

Can I upload images larger than 20MB?
No, images must be under 20MB.
